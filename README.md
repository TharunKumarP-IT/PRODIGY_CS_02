🔐 Image Encryption & Decryption Tool using Pixel Manipulation

This project is a simple image encryption and decryption tool developed using Python.
It demonstrates how pixel manipulation techniques can be used to secure images.

The tool applies:

Pixel swapping

XOR mathematical operation

These operations are reversible, allowing the same logic to be used for both encryption and decryption.

🛠 Technologies Used

Python 🐍

Pillow (PIL) Library

🔍 How It Works

Reads the input image pixel by pixel

Swaps pixel positions horizontally

Applies XOR operation using a secret key

Saves the encrypted image

Applying the same process again decrypts the image

🎯 Features

Simple and beginner-friendly

Uses pixel-level operations

Reversible encryption

Educational mini-project

🚀 Future Enhancements

GUI using Tkinter

Password-based encryption

Random pixel shuffling

Support for PNG images
